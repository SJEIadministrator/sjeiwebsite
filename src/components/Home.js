        <h3>Environmental Justice</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Environmental justice is the fair treatment and meaningful
              involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin,
              or income, with respect to the development, implementation,
              and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies, (EPA).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              We will take this a step further and include the consideration
              of all inhabitants, including animals.

        <h3>Ethical Engineering</h3>

            <p>
              Engineers, in the fulfillment of their professional duties,
              shall: Hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Perform services only in areas of their competence.
              Issue public statements only in an objective and truthful manner.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Act for each employer or client as faithful agents or trustees.
              Avoid deceptive acts. Conduct themselves honorably, responsibly,
              ethically, and lawfully so as to enhance the honor, reputation,
              and usefulness of the profession. (I. Fundamental Cannons, National

              Our initial work will be to compose these three similar definitions
              and subjects into a guiding principles that will allow our
              organization to fulfill our goals and bylaws.

        <h3>Social Justice</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              The fair and proper administration of laws conforming
              to the natural law that all persons, irrespective of ethnic origin,
              gender, possessions, race, religion, etc., are to be treated equally
              and without prejudice, (Business Directory).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Further, social justice is the virtue which guides us
              in creating those organized human interactions we call institutions.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              In turn, social institutions, when justly organized, provide
              us with access to what is good for the person, both individually
              and in our associations with others.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Social justice also imposes on each of us a personal responsibility
              to work with others, at whatever level of the “Common Good” in which
              we participate, to design and continually perfect our institutions as
              tools for personal and social development, (Center for Economic and Social Justice).
